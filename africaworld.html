            Zebras are closely related to horses but they’re not the same species.
             They’re in the same family (called Equidae) and they can even breed
              with each other, but zebras aren’t just striped horses as they evolved
               separately. Zebras are closely related to horses but they’re not the same species.

      <h2>Leopard</h2>
      
      <div id="myDIV2">
            Leopards are graceful and powerful big cats closely related to lions,
             tigers, and jaguars. They live in sub-Saharan Africa, northeast Africa,
              Central Asia, India, and China. However, many of their populations
               are endangered, especially outside of Africa.
               The leopard is so strong and comfortable in trees that it often hauls 
               its kills into the branches. By dragging the bodies of large animals
                aloft it hopes to keep them safe from scavengers such as hyenas. 
                Leopards can also hunt from trees, where their spotted coats allow 
                them to blend with the leaves until they spring with a deadly pounce.'
         These nocturnal predators also stalk antelope, deer, and pigs by stealthy
          movements in the tall grass. When human settlements are present, leopards 
          often attack dogs and, occasionally, people.<br>

            Poaching and land clearing for agriculture and human
             settlement in the 1970s and 80s decimated black rhinoceros 
             populations across Africa, with numbers plummeting from 100,000 to 
             fewer than 4,000 animals.Today black rhinos are found in habitats
              ranging from desert in south-western Africa to the montane forests 
              of Kenya. The eastern black rhino (Diceros bicornis michaeli) is
               the most endangered of the surviving black rhino subspecies, with
                fewer than 850 individuals remaining
